<h2>Project 1: Visualizing Anscombeâ€™s Quartet</h2>

<b>Who did it</b>: Yawen Zhang

<b>Tasks finished</b>: Part 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Note that part 2 and 4 are merged together)

<b>Resources I used</b>:
- I referred to the web page https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13645446/sort-data-for-d3-js-path on how to sort data before plotting the line graph. I learned about the sort command and apply it into our task. Before plotting the line graph in Part 2, I sorted the x value first.
- I referred to the web page http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369 on how to use the tooltips, however, for the specific requirements in Part 4, I wrote the code about click, mouseover and mouseout functions myself as to satisfy the interactive requirements about changing color and showing the x and y values.
- I referred to the web page https://bl.ocks.org/ctufts/298bfe4b11989960eeeecc9394e9f118 on how to calculate the trendline.
