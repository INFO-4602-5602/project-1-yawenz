<b>Resources I used</b>:
- I refer the web page http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369 about creating the tooltip, however, for the requirements in Part four, I wrote the code about click, mouseover and mouseout functions myself as to satisfy the interactive requirements about changing color and showing the x and y values.
