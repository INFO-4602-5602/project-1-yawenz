<h3>Info</h3>

<b>Who did it</b>: Yawen Zhang

<b>Tasks finished</b>: Part one, two, three, four and five (Note that part two and four are merged together)

<b>Resources I used</b>:
- I refer this web page http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369 about recreating the tooltip, however, for the requirements in Part four, I wrote the code about click, mouseover and mouseout functions myself as to satisfy the interactive requirements about changing color and showing the x and y values.
